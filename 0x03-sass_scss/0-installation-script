## IMPORTAND
Note: The specified version sass@3.7.4 resulted in an ETARGET error
because that version does not exist for the 'sass' npm package.
The current, official Dart Sass implementation was installed instead.

## Steps for installation
1. Navigated to the project directory (alx-intermediate-frontend/0x03-sass_scss)
2. Executed the global installation command for the latest stable version of Dart Sass:
npm install -g sass
3. Verified the installation:
sass --version
